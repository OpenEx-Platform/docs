    We are doing our best to complete this page. If you want to participate, don't hesitate to join the [Filigran Community on Slack](https://community.filigran.io) or submit your pull request on the [Github doc repository](https://github.com/OpenBAS-Platform/docs).

The Home screen provides visitors of the OpenBAS platform with an overview of the platform's live activity and a
snapshot of your global security posture. Below is a breakdown of the various widgets available on this page.

## Metric cards

This section displays the count of different components within the platform, shown in two metrics:

- The first metric represents the number of objects created over the last 180 days.
- The second metric reflects the number of objects created in the last 30 days.

!!! note

    From here, the data is based on simulations created and launched within the last 180 days.

## Performance overview

This section highlights the results of your simulation inject expectations, categorized in three types: prevention,
detection, and human response.

## Simulations

This bar chart represents simulations grouped by week, based on their start date.

## Top simulation categories

This polar chart aggregates all simulations by category, giving you a visual breakdown of the top categories.

## Top attack patterns

This horizontal bar chart displays the top attack patterns identified in your simulations, based on the number of
injects associated with each attack pattern.

## Last simulations

Here, we display the six most recent simulations, sorted in descending order by their start date.

## MITRE ATT&CK Coverage

This section presents the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, based on the results of your simulation inject expectations. It provides
an overview of which tactics and techniques have been covered in your simulations.
